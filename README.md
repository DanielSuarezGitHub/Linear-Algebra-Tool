Linear Algebra Library

A Java-based library for performing matrix operations with infinite precision.
.

**Key Capabilities:**
* **Exact RREF:** `calculaterref()` performs Gaussian elimination keeping values as fractions.
* **Rank Calculation:** `getRank()` determines the true rank without numerical noise.
* **Operation Logging:** The `Matrix` class logs every row operation (Swap, Scale, Add) to trace the algorithm's path.# Linear-Algebra-Tool
